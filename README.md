# CryptoBnB

Onchain hospitality

- A host sets up a CryptoBnb place (with certain parameters, e.g. price per time unit)
- Guests can reserve the place for a time period (a reservation could be some sort of NFT). The reservation confirmed if the time period is available and if the amount received is sufficient for that time period.
- Guests can unlock the CryptoBnb place (or a linked keysafe) by sending an `unlock()` transaction during the duration of the reservation
- Hosts and guests can rate each other after the reservation ended (star-based system)
